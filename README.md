# PyBer_Analysis

###### Overview of the analysis: 
This project is to understand the different factors that can affect each other. Also, visualize the changes by period. 
###### Results: 
Please see the summary data frame below:
![summary](https://github.com/Sirius0531/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/summary.PNG)
1. Urban has the most ride counts(1625), 13 times more than rural, which has the lowest counts (125).
2. The driver counts and total fares amount ($) also reflect the same due to the high and low demand. 
3. Due to the higher volume of the rides and drivers, Urban has the lowest average ride fares and driver fares.

Please see the monthly fares trend as below:

Based on the line chart, we can see that the fares are fluctuated from time to time. It all started low in January and increased the price month by month. In suburban, the price decreased after March, while the rural area had steadily increased and the urban area had fluctuated a lot. 
###### Summary: 
Urban areas are the most populous, and people need to go to work, go to school, or may have more opportunities to hang out in different places in the cities.
That cased the urban area has higher competition than other 2 areas, due to the high volume demand and more drivers in an urban area. It can also affect by the distance of the rides are shorter in the urban area and longer in the rural area.
Also, it might be because people in rural areas have a higher chance to own a car, so they use to drive themselves, not call for the drivers.
